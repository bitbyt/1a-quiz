### A simple quiz game for GA WDI

##### Overview

The idea of the game is to create a quiz that's exclusively front end base but to be used as a foundation for future polling projects.

Objectively, the project is a testing ground for OOP principles. This also makes it highly extendable for future use.

##### About the game

This game is a simple 2 player quiz in which a player is presented with a question with true or false input.
